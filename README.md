Small canvas physics and dynamic project for practicing HTML canvas and JavaScript animations.

# Ball Bouncing Game

A simple physics-based bouncing ball game built using **HTML**, **CSS** and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

In this game multiple balls bounce around the screen.  
Each ball is affected by gravity and friction.

## 🎯 Goal
I built this project to practice canvas animation, physics simulation, and JavaScript classes.

This project is based on a YouTube tutorial that I followed as a learning exercise.

## 📂 Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `index.html` | main HTML file |
| `style.css` | styling |
| `gravity.js` | JavaScript animation + physics logic |
| `dynamic.js` | JavaScript file for user-created balls that bounce around without gravity (balls are added when user clicks on canvas) |

## 🚀 Future improvements

- adding collision detection between balls  
- adding UI to change gravity or friction  
- adding score system

## 🧠 What I learned in this project:

- how `requestAnimationFrame` works  
- how to draw on HTML Canvas  
- how to use classes in JS  
- how to implement gravity + friction formulas
